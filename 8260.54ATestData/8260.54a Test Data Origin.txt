(item 1) "8260.54a Test Cases and Expected Results.xlsx" is direct pull of data with no edits
(item 2) "8660.54a Test Cases and Expected Results-rev.xlsx" is modified (item 1) to format numbers
         to show same precision as shown on original source website.  Otherwise files are the same.
(item 3) CSV files created by saving individual workbooks from (item 2) as comma delimited files.
         Afterwards CSV's were edited to comment out all headers in the file with the character '#'.
		 No further edits dones.
(item 4) The '-' character for negative values exported from Excell to CSV as '?'.  The CSV '?' were
		 all changed to '-' by hand to match the Excell spreadsheets.
(item 5) In 8260.54A the test case for "Pt is on Locus" shows in error, Locus End Longitude as latitude
		 values (70:24:20.88368N, should be 70:24:20.88368W).  I have changed this in the PtIsOnLocus.csv
		 file.
(item 6) In 8260.54A the test case for "Locus Crs At Point" shows in error, Locus End Longitude as latitude
		 values (70:24:20.88368N, should be 70:24:20.88368W).  I have changed this in the LocusCrsAtPoint.csv
		 file.
(item 7) In 8260.54A the test case for "Locus Arc Intersect" has erronous input values for Test11, Test41,
		 Test43, Test51, Test53, Test55, Test56, Test60, Test61, Test62, Test63, Test64, Test65, Test66,
		 Test67, Test68, Test69, Test70.
		 
		 This appears to be some sort of formatting error with the publishing of 8260.54A.  I've gone ahead
		 and fixed the data inputs both in my Excel spreadsheet and the my test case data.
